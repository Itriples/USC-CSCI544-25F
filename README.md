# 2. Multi-Agent Market Researcher (Applied)
- Agents: one scrapes competitor data, one summarizes market trends, one generates SWOT analysis, one validates findings.
- Use case: Automates consulting-style market research for startups or SMEs.

# 3. 	Recommendation System with Text + Metadata (Applied)
- Combine embeddings from text (e.g., product reviews) with structured data (ratings, price) for hybrid recommendations.
- Great e-commerce angle.

# 4.  Faithful & Source-Grounded Summarization (Research)
- Build a summarization model that not only generates concise summaries but also highlights supporting evidence spans in the source documents.
- Novelty: Tackles the hallucination problem in LLM summarization.

# 5. Explainable Toxicity Detection (Research)
- Train a toxicity classifier that not only predicts labels but also provides human-interpretable explanations (e.g., highlighting offensive spans).
- Novelty: Bridges fairness + explainability in NLP.
